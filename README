We are excited to introduce the instructions for PanTeraV application. PanTeraV is a part
of Tali Malenboim’s thesis. Tali is (currently) a PhD student, with the guidance of
Professor Robert Moskovitch. Our lab is called Complex Data Analytics (CDA) lab in Ben
Gurion University of the Negev. Due to the sharing community in the CDA lab, PanTeraV
was integrated into the CDA lab website, which consists of multiple algorithms and
platforms. In order to submit the system application by itself, we made a standalone
version of the PanTeraV’s server and client. Both of these can be explored and executed
using the supplied links in this document.
In order to execute the whole system of PanTeraV, which includes both a server side and
a client side, please follow the instructions:

This is the client side for PanTeraV project.
In order to run the client, please follow these stages:
* Make sure you have npm installed on your PC. 
If not, please download it in the website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager.
* Install using npm, all the packages in the package.json file.
* run react client side by executing the command: "npm start".
